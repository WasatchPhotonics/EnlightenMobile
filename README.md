# EnlightenMobile

This branch contains an experimental rewrite,

The purpose is to simplify compliance with [#33](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/EnlightenMobile/issues/33) and prepare for EOY development goals.

[new] This branch will also help with compliance of [#34](https://github.com/WasatchPhotonics/EnlightenMobile/issues/34) in service of 3-4 year development goals.

If this project is succesful, we may consider mainlining it into the original EnlightenMobile project.
We will want to integrate existing documentation related to app publishing. (README_IOS.MD)
